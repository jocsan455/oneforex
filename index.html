        <h1 class="font-30">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
        <span class="pamms">(PAMM Service)</span><br>
      <strong>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERN THE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ONE FOREX SIGNAL LLC., HEREINAFTER CALLED "<span class="text-underline">THE ASSET MANAGER</span>", AND THE USER OF THIS WEBSITE INTERESTED IN REQUESTING OUR FOREX MANAGED ACCOUNT SERVICE, HEREINAFTER CALLED "<span class="text-underline">THE INVESTOR</span>". WHEN "THE INVESTOR" HIRES "THE ASSET MANAGER", IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT "THE INVESTOR" HAS READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</strong><br><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE INVESTOR" declares to be 18 years of age or older, who acts in his own name and rights, who is able to sign a legally binding contract and who undertakes to assume full responsibility for the profits or losses obtained in his forex account as a result of joining our forex managed account service.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE ASSET MANAGER" is an international company that uses its own funds to invest in the currency market (Foreign Exchange), making transactions of buying and selling different currency pairs, in a discretionary way, using its own investment methodology, automated trading systems and technological infrastructure.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE ASSET MANAGER" does not offer an investment advisory service, nor is it an investment adviser or registered broker and does not intend to say or suggest to "THE INVESTOR" what assets or currencies it should buy or sell on its own. If "THE INVESTOR" requires financial advice to participate in the forex market, it must request financial advice from an independent adviser, duly regulated and specialized in the forex market.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE INVESTOR" declares that he is the legal owner of the funds deposited in his forex account, that they are of lawful verifiable origin, that are not related to criminal activities, such as: drug trafficking, terrorism or fraud, and that he exonerates "THE ASSET MANAGER" of all responsibility in relation to the origin of said funds.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE INVESTOR" undertakes to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless "THE ASSET MANAGER", their directors, employees, agents, independent contractors, attorneys, bank accounts, parent companies, affiliates, affiliates, successors and assigns, from and against any and all liability, claims, actions or claims by "THE INVESTOR" or any other party, as a result of or in connection with the forex managed account service offered by "THE ASSET MANAGER" through this website.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">The forex managed account service offered by "THE ASSET MANAGER", may be solicited only and exclusively by those clients who have an open forex investment account in any of the brokers recommended on this website or who open a new forex account using our referral link. "THE ASSET MANAGER" reserves the right to manage forex investment accounts opened in other brokers. </p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE INVESTOR" must hires "THE ASSET MANAGER" through the electronic form provided by the broker Key To Markets, in order to authorize "THE ASSET MANAGER" to perform the transactions of buying and selling currencies that it deems convenient. If you already have a funded KTM account, please click on the following Link, in order to hire "THE ASSET MANAGER".</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">The powers granted by "THE INVESTOR" to "THE ASSET MANAGER" are limited to the realization of the transactions of buying and selling currency pairs that "THE ASSET MANAGER" considers convenient. "THE ASSET MANAGER" is legally precluded by the regulatory authorities and by the brokers themselves from transferring funds from the "THE INVESTOR" forex account to any bank account or even another account opened in the same broker or any other broker. "THE INVESTOR" is the only one authorized and legally capable of moving funds from his forex account to a bank account or other forex account, which must always be in the name of "THE INVESTOR".</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE INVESTOR" understands and agrees that when hiring "THE ASSET MANAGER", he is making a manifestation of his full will and consent to allow "THE ASSET MANAGER" to manage his forex account, making the transactions of buying and selling currency pairs that it considers convenient in the forex market, without implying any guarantee that “THE INVESTOR” will obtain positive returns.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">As a financial compensation for its forex managed account service, "THE ASSET MANAGER" will receive a Performance Fee of 30%, to be applied to the net profits obtained at the end of each month. </p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">The policy of High Water-Mark is applied in order to protect "THE INVESTOR" from unfair payment of fees. Below you can find an example of how the High Water-Mark policy works.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">Suppose that you invested an amount of $10,000. If at the end of the first month the balance of your account closes at $11,000, the net gain will be $1,000 and the performance fee of One Forex Signal will be $300 ($1,000 x 30%). The High Water-Mark will be set at $10,700 ($11,000 - $300). Then, if by the second month your account ends with a loss of <span class="red">-$400</span>, the current balance will become $10,300 ($10,700 - $400) and One Forex Signal will not receive a performance fee in that second month. The High Water-Mark continues to be established at $10,700. This means that One Forex Signal can only receive a commission again if at the end of the third month (or any of the following months), the balance becomes greater than $10,700. Now, suppose that at the end of the third month the balance ends at $12,500. To determine the result, the following calculation will be made: $12,500 - $10,700 - <span class="red">$400</span> = $1,400. Therefore, the profit of the third month will be $1,400 and the commission of One Forex Signal will be $420 ($1,400 x 30%).</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE INVESTOR" may suspend the handling of his forex account at any time by means of a simple written notification to the broker, without the need of third party authorization or prior notification to "THE ASSET MANAGER". When "THE INVESTOR" makes use of this right, "THE ASSET MANAGER" will not apply penalties or charges for withdrawal of funds, unless it has been expressly agreed upon and recorded by a contract duly signed by both parties.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE INVESTOR" may increase the balance of his forex account at any time, without prior notice to "THE ASSET MANAGER". Similarly, "THE INVESTOR" may withdraw all or part of its funds, at any time and without prior notice to "THE ASSET MANAGER". However, it is advisable that "THE INVESTOR" notifies via e-mail to "THE ASSET MANAGER", at least 48 hours in advance, of any withdrawals he has planned to make from his forex account.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">The minimum recommended term for "THE INVESTOR" to hire "THE ASSET MANAGER", is three (3) months. If "THE INVESTOR" decides to revoke the powers granted to "THE ASSET MANAGER" to manage his forex account, the open positions will be closed immediately by the broker regardless of whether there are floating losses or profits.</p><br>
      <p class="text-justify">"THE INVESTOR" understands and accepts that "THE ASSET MANAGER" does not guarantee that it can return to the results obtained so far. The results shown on this website and social networks should be viewed as hypothetical results, which may not be duplicated in the forex account of "THE INVESTOR". "THE ASSET MANAGER" does not guarantee "THE INVESTOR" that he will obtain profits in his forex account as a result of contracting the forex managed account service offered on this website.</p><br>

"THE ASSET MANAGER" assumes no responsibility for the impact that such inconveniences or events may have on the results.</p><br>

        <li>GBPUSD</li>
        <li>USDCHF</li>

    </ul><br>
      <strong class="text-left">Can I choose the currency pairs in which I want to invest?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">Yes, you can. However, it is highly recommended to copy all our trades so that the results are similar to ours. Investors who join any of our PAMM platforms will not be able to select the currency pairs where they wish to invest. </p>
      <strong class="text-left">What is the recommended minimum balance?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">To maintain our same level of risk, the minimum balance should be $1,000. It is your risk and decision to use a lower balance.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">Is there any difference between the strategy used in the PAMM platform and the Forex Signal?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">No, none. However, the subscribers of our forex signal could obtain different results from the investors that join the PAMM platforms, due to technical factors, such as: Latency, Slippage, freezing of the MT4 platform, restart of the VPS, different spreads, commissions of the brokers, etc. Our PAMM platforms offer a professional negotiation environment, where the best technical conditions exist for investing in forex. Therefore, through the PAMM platforms, investors obtain exact returns to those in One Forex Signal.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">Do you offer assistance for the installation of remote copy software??</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">Yes. However, it is highly recommended that you request assistance directly from the technical support team of the remote copy technology provider of your choice.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">What is the investment strategy used?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">That is proprietary information highly confidential. However, we can say that unlike conventional technical analysis, our system establishes a series of price levels over which we act automatically, through a sophisticated trading robot. Usually, we invest 0.10 per each $10,000 of balance. The used leverage do not excess 1:10. Our strategy seeks to achieve individual and collective profit targets in each currency pair, but we also have foreseen a global objective of benefits to be achieved collectively among all currency pairs. When our expectations are not met in the market, the robot performs the progressive and organized closing of those positions whose profit potential has decreased. Additionally, we use direct and indirect hedging techniques in order to try to protect the equity. Our robot has taken into account different levels of capital defense, starting with the use of dynamic Stop Loss and Take Profit hidden to the broker, in addition to security subsystems that minimize the possibility of a loss occurring beyond what is budgeted. Our main goal is the constant equity growth with a low level of risk.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">How frequent is the trading of your trading strategy?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">We trade simultaneously in 11 currency pairs with a lot size of 0.1 for each balance of $10,000. We look for trading opportunities from the opening of the London Stock Exchange until the close of the NYSE. Also, sometimes we can start trading when the Tokyo Stock Exchange opens.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">How many trades do you keep open simultaneously?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">Usually, we have less than 11 open trades. However, it may happen that we open more positions, if necessary.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">How risky is your investment strategy?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">Our strategy is active, but it is not aggressive in terms of risk. In a $10,000 account, the size of each trade will be 0.1 Lot. The size of our positions is considered medium risk. However, due to the active monitoring of the portfolio and our rapid reactions to market events, we maintain an effective equity protection while achieving solid absolute returns.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">Do you use Stop Loss and Take Profit?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">Yes, we use dynamic Stop Loss and Take Profit hidden to the broker. This means that our exit levels change constantly according to market conditions and in addition, the broker will never know our exit points.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">What methods do you use to mitigate Drawdown?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">We use direct and indirect hedging techniques, selective closing of trades with little probability of success and also, we add more trades in the currency pairs with greater potential to generate profits.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">What is the maximum Drawdown that you are allowed to achieve?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">If the floating loss of 10% is reached, the robot will initiate the progressive and organized closing of the positions. If 20% of drawdown is reached, the robot will close all positions and temporarily stop its operation.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">Can I establish a risk level higher than One Forex Signal?</strong>

      <strong class="text-left">Do you use grid, martingale or arbitrage techniques?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">Usually not. However, it can happen that the robot adds some trades in a certain currency pair, after a corrective movement with limited potential occurs, if there is still a mathematical probability that the price will recover and continues in our favor.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">Is your trading manual, automatic or mixed (semi-automatic)?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">We operate semi-automatically, In order to take advantage of the advantages offered by our experience in the financial markets.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">What is the leverage you use?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">Our broker allows us a leverage of 1: 500. However, we do not usually use a leverage greater than 1:30.</p>
      <strong class="text-left">What investment platform do you use?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">We use the MetaTrader 4 platform, latest version, together with PAMM (Percentage Allocation Management Module).</p>
      <strong class="text-left">Do I need a VPS to join your Forex Signal?</strong>
      <p class="text-justify">Yes, it is absolutely necessary. Local Trade Copier plans include hosting your Mt4 on a managed server, so you can enjoy a “hands-free” copying experience.

    <strong class="text-left">What is a PAMM Platform?</strong>
    <p class="text-justify">PAMM is the acronym for Percentage Allocation Management Module. It is a state-of-the-art technological investment platform provided by some brokers to asset managers, in order to allow them to simultaneously manage the funds of their investors. However, the broker maintains the administrative separation of each investor's funds, including, guaranteeing the right of each one to withdraw their funds at any time, in whole or in part and without the need for third-party authorization. The profits or losses resulting from the operations of the asset manager will be distributed proportionally among the investors, based on the capital individually invested in the PAMM. For his professional work, the asset manager will charge a performance fee (commission) which will be applied to the net profits obtained at the end of each month. Said performance fee will be automatically deducted and credited to the fund manager's account. EXAMPLE:</p>
    <ul class="text-left" style="column-count: 3;">
        <li class="text-underline font-weight-bold">Investors:</li>                                    
        <li>Invester A:</li>                                
        <li>Invester B</li>

        <li>$10,000</li>
        <li>$20,000</li>

        <li>$80,000</li>

        <li>53.33%</li> 
        <li>100%</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p class="text-justify" >If at the end of the month $15,000 of net profit has been generated and the performance fee of the asset manager was agreed upon 30%, the asset manager's fees will be: $15,000 X 30% = $4,500. The resulting net profits will be: $10,500, which will be distributed automatically among investors, as follows:</p>
    <ul class="text-left" style="column-count: 3;">
        <li class="text-underline font-weight-bold">Investors:</li>

        <li>$5,599.65</li> 
    </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">For the convenience of investors, the high water-mark policy applies. This means that if the asset manager has not generated profits at the end of the month, he will not receive his performance fee. </p>
        <strong class="text-left">What is the High Water-Mark policy and how does it work?</strong>
        <p class="text-justify">It is a formula to calculate the fees of asset managers and protect investors from paying unfair fees. The high water-mark policy guarantees the investor that he will only pay fees to the manager if his investment has experienced a net growth. For a better understanding, below is an example of how the high water-mark policy works:</p>
        <p  class="text-justify">Suppose that you invested in one of our PAMM platforms an amount of $10,000 and that our performance fee is 30%. If at the end of the first month, the balance of your account closes at $11,000, the net gain will be $1,000 and the performance fee of “One Forex Signal” will be $300 ($1,000 x 30%). The high water-mark will be set at $10,700 (Result: $ 11,000 - $ 300). Then, if by the second month your account ends with a loss of -$400, the current balance will become $10,300 (Result: $10,700 - $400) and “One Forex Signal” will not receive a performance fee in that second month. The high water-mark continues to be established at $10,700. This means that “One Forex Signal” can only receive a commission again, if at the end of the third month (or any of the following months), the balance becomes greater than $10,700. Now, suppose that at the end of the third month the balance ends at $ 12,500. To determine the result, the following calculation will be made: $12,500 - $10,700 - $400 = $1,400. Therefore, the profit of the third month will be $1,400 and the performance fee of “One Forex Signal” will be $420 (Result: $ 1,400 x 30%).</p>
